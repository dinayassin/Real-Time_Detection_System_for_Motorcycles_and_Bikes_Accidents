# Real-Time_Detection_System_for_Motorcycles_and_Bikes_Accidents
Engineering Final Project: Real-time detection system for motorcycles and bikes accidents. The system was built using an Arduino which interfaces with various functional sensors, and an Android app user interface to receive/send alerts and notifications as soon as an accident detected by processing various signals in real-time situational awareness.
